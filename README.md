## welcome
This page is intented to give people a quick starting guide to the programming language Python. The content is directed to developers trying out Python for the first time, as well as people who are new to programming and try to get up to speed quickly with pratical examples. A quick word of advice especially for the newbies - do not get discouraged - I spend a lot of time on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)(great ressource to check if you are stuck), meaning: programming is like life-long learning; you will never have mastered everything. And always remember: `Fear is the path to the Dark Side`.

## setup

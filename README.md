## welcome
This page is intented to give people a quick starting guide to the programming language Python. The content is directed to developers trying out Python for the first time, as well as people who are new to programming and try to get up to speed quickly with pratical examples. A quick word of advice especially for the newbies - do not get discouraged - I spend a lot of time on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)(great ressource to check if you are stuck), meaning: programming is like life-long learning; you will never have mastered everything. And always remember: `Fear is the path to the Dark Side`.

## setup
Without further ado lets get you started!

**1. Install me:**  
Python was ported to many platforms and might in fact already be running on your system. But we still have to make sure that you are running a compatible version.
Please **do not** download `Python 3.x`, as it is a newer version, which at this point does not provide the learning packages we use in this tutorial.

### Mac, Linux
Here we just need to make sure that you have a relatively new python version. This will make your life a lot easier. Just open the `terminal`-app (e.g.: [mac-os-x](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)), [linux ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)) and type the following:

```bash
python --version
```

You should get something like `Python 2.7.6`. Everything above `Python 2.6.x` and below `Python 3.x` should be more than enough for this tutorial. If you have a lower version number, please go to the [official python website](http://www.python.org/download/) and download the newest version.

### Windows
 It is not very likely that you have Python installed without your knowledge, so you can just go to the [official python website](http://www.python.org/download/) and download the newest `Python 2.7.x` for windows there.
